class NumiBank:
    """
    A simple loan management system that allows you to create customers, manage loans,
    and process repayments.

    This class provides methods for:
        - Creating customers (`create_customer`)
        - Granting loans to customers (`lend`)
        - Processing loan repayments (`repay`)
        - Retrieving customer + loan information (`get_customer_info`)

    **Example Usage:**

    ```python
    # Example usage:

    from numibank import NumiBank
    bank = NumiBank()
    # Create a customer
    customer = bank.create_customer(1001, "Muniu Kariuki")
    # Grant a loan to the customer
    loan = bank.lend(customer.customer_id, customer.name, Decimal(100.0), Decimal(0.05)) # 5% interest rate and our max we can loan is 100
    # Fetch  the outstanding
    outstanding_debt = loan.outstanding_debt
    print(f"Outstanding debt (no repayments yet): {outstanding_debt}")  # Expected Output: 105
    # letâ€™s do a repayement
    loan.add_repayment(Decimal(5.0))  # Add a repayment
    print(f"Outstanding debt after repayment: {loan.outstanding_debt}")  # Expected Output: 100

    # Get customer information and loan details
    customer_info = bank.get_customer_info(customer_id)
    print(customer_info)
